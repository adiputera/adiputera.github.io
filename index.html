                        <p>Java is a popular programming language used for building scalable, secure, and cross-platform
                            enterprise applications. It powers web applications, APIs, backend systems, and business
                            platforms such as ERP, CRM, and e-commerce systems. Its strong ecosystem, stability, and

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a web framework in the Spring ecosystem used to build
                            structured, maintainable web applications with clear separation between business logic and
                            user interfaces. Spring Boot, on the other hand, is a framework built on top of Spring that
                            simplifies configuration and deployment. It allows developers to quickly create
                            production-ready applications with minimal setup — reducing boilerplate and making
                            development faster and more efficient.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The main difference between Spring MVC and Spring Boot lies in configuration and ease of use.
                            Spring MVC requires manual setup and configuration of dependencies, web.xml, and context
                            files. Spring Boot automates much of that, using “convention over configuration” and
                            embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty to run applications directly — making it ideal for
                            microservices and rapid development.</p>
