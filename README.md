### Technical Expertise

**29. What is Java used for in enterprise applications?**  
Java is a popular programming language used for building scalable, secure, and cross-platform enterprise applications. It powers web applications, APIs, backend systems, and business platforms such as ERP, CRM, and e-commerce systems. Its strong ecosystem, stability, and performance make it a preferred language for enterprise-grade software.

**30. What is Spring MVC and Spring Boot?**  
Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a web framework in the Spring ecosystem used to build structured, maintainable web applications with clear separation between business logic and user interfaces. Spring Boot, on the other hand, is a framework built on top of Spring that simplifies configuration and deployment. It allows developers to quickly create production-ready applications with minimal setup — reducing boilerplate and making development faster and more efficient.

**31. What is the difference between Spring MVC and Spring Boot?**  
The main difference between Spring MVC and Spring Boot lies in configuration and ease of use. Spring MVC requires manual setup and configuration of dependencies, web.xml, and context files. Spring Boot automates much of that, using “convention over configuration” and embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty to run applications directly — making it ideal for microservices and rapid development.

**32. What is SAP Commerce (Hybris)?**  
SAP Commerce (formerly Hybris) is an enterprise-level e-commerce platform built on Java and the Spring Framework. It provides powerful tools for managing product catalogs, pricing, promotions, and customer experiences across web, mobile, and omnichannel environments. It is widely used by large companies to handle complex B2B and B2C digital commerce operations.

**33. What is the role of a Lead Software Engineer in SAP Commerce projects?**  
A Lead Software Engineer in SAP Commerce projects is responsible for overseeing the technical architecture, ensuring high performance, and leading a team of developers. The role involves designing scalable backend systems, integrating APIs, maintaining data models, and ensuring code quality through best practices and code reviews. They also collaborate with business and infrastructure teams to deliver reliable e-commerce solutions.

**34. What is SAP Customer Data Platform (SAP CDP)?**  
SAP Customer Data Platform (SAP CDP) enables organizations to unify and manage customer data securely across channels, helping brands deliver personalized and consent-based experiences at scale.

**35. What is SAP Emarsys?**  
SAP Emarsys is a customer engagement platform focused on marketing automation, providing tools for personalized omnichannel communication, campaign orchestration, and customer lifecycle management.
